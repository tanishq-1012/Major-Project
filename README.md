# 🐜 Artificial Evolution of Ant using AI

## Overview

This project simulates the **evolution and survival behavior** of an artificial ant in a grid-based environment using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**. Inspired by natural selection and survival of the fittest, the project aims to recreate adaptive and intelligent ant behavior in a constrained virtual ecosystem.
Developed as a **Final Year Major Project** by **Tanishq Sharma** and **Aman Raj**, this work integrates evolutionary computation and AI to model how an artificial agent (ant) learns to find food and survive.
